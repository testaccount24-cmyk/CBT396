//***FILE 396 is from Scott Hawley of Indianapolis, Indiana,        *   FILE 396
//*           and contains a very handy REXX exec to do a quick     *   FILE 396
//*           text search of a pds from an ISPF 3.4 panel.  The     *   FILE 396
//*           name of the exec is FINDSTR, and it invokes           *   FILE 396
//*           ISRSUPC to do the text search.                        *   FILE 396
//*                                                                 *   FILE 396
//*           This little widget has been VERY nice to have.        *   FILE 396
//*           It's meant to be used with the 3.4 panel as a line    *   FILE 396
//*           command.  I hate having to do the old cut/bounce      *   FILE 396
//*           to 3.14/paste game.  The way it's written you can     *   FILE 396
//*           simply say FINDSTR A HAPPY SYSPROG (no quotes) as     *   FILE 396
//*           a line command and a pds search is done with          *   FILE 396
//*           ISRSUPC for the phrase 'A HAPPY SYSPROG'.             *   FILE 396
